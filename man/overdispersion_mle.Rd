\title{Estimate the Overdispersion for a Vector of Counts}
\usage{
overdispersion_mle(
  y,
  mean,
  model_matrix = NULL,
  do_cox_reid_adjustment = !is.null(model_matrix),
  subsample = FALSE,
  max_iter = 200,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a numeric or integer vector or matrix with the counts for which
the overdispersion is estimated}

\item{mean}{a numeric vector of either length 1 or \code{length(y)} or if
\code{y} is a matrix, a matrix with the same dimensions. Contains
the predicted value for that sample. If missing: \code{mean(y)} / \code{rowMeans(y)}}

\item{model_matrix}{a numeric matrix that specifies the experimental
design. It can be produced using \code{stats::model.matrix()}.
Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{do_cox_reid_adjustment}{the classical maximum likelihood estimator of the \code{overdisperion} is biased
towards small values. McCarthy \emph{et al.} (2012) showed that it is preferable to optimize the Cox-Reid
adjusted profile likelihood.\cr
\code{do_cox_reid_adjustment} can be either be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} to indicate if the adjustment is
added during the optimization of the \code{overdispersion} parameter. Default: \code{TRUE} if a
model matrix is provided, otherwise \code{FALSE}}

\item{subsample}{the estimation of the overdispersion is the slowest step when fitting
a Gamma-Poisson GLM. For datasets with many samples, the estimation can be considerably sped up
without loosing much precision by fitting the overdispersion only on a random subset of the samples.
Default: \code{FALSE} which means that the data is not subsampled. If set to \code{TRUE}, at most 1,000 samples
are considered. Otherwise the parameter just specifies the number of samples that are considered
for each gene to estimate the overdispersion.}

\item{max_iter}{the maximum number of iterations for each gene}

\item{verbose}{a boolean that indicates if information about the individual steps are printed
while fitting the GLM. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The function returs a list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{estimate}}{the numerical estimate of the overdispersion.}
\item{\code{iterations}}{the number of iterations it took to calculate
the result.}
\item{\code{message}}{additional information about the fitting process.}
}
}
\description{
Estimate the Overdispersion for a Vector of Counts
}
\details{
The function is optimized to be fast on many small counts. To
achieve this, the frequency table of the counts is calculated and
used to avoid repetitive calculations. If
there are probably many unique counts the optimization is skipped.
Currently the heuristic is to skip if more than half of the counts
are expected to be unique. The estimation is based on the largest observed
count in \code{y}.

An earlier version of this package (< 1.1.1) used a separate
set of functions for the case of many small counts based on a paper
by Bandara et al. (2019). However, this
didn't bring a sufficient performance increase and meant an
additional maintenance burden.

\examples{
 set.seed(1)
 # true overdispersion = 2.4
 y <- rnbinom(n = 10, mu = 3, size = 1/2.4)
 # estimate = 1.7
 overdispersion_mle(y)


 # true overdispersion = 0
 y <- rpois(n = 10, lambda = 3)
 # estimate = 0
 overdispersion_mle(y)
 # with different mu, overdispersion estimate changes
 overdispersion_mle(y, mean = 15)
 # Cox-Reid adjustment changes the result
 overdispersion_mle(y, mean = 15, do_cox_reid_adjustment = FALSE)


 # Many very small counts, true overdispersion = 50
 y <- rnbinom(n = 1000, mu = 0.01, size = 1/50)
 summary(y)
 # estimate = 31
 overdispersion_mle(y, do_cox_reid_adjustment = TRUE)

 # Function can also handle matrix input
 Y <- matrix(rnbinom(n = 10 * 3, mu = 4, size = 1/2.2), nrow = 10, ncol = 3)
