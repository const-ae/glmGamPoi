\arguments{
\item{fit}{object of class \code{glmGamPoi}. Usually the result of calling \code{glm_gp(data, ...)}}

\item{contrast}{The contrast to test. Can be a single column name (quoted or as a string)
that is removed from the  full model matrix of \code{fit}. Or a complex contrast comparing two
or more columns: e.g. \code{A - B}, \code{"A - 3 * B"}, \code{(A + B) / 2 - C} etc. For complicated
experimental design that involved nested conditions, you specify the condition level to compare
using the \code{fact()} helper function. \cr
Only one of \code{contrast} or \code{reduced_design} must be specified.}

\item{reduced_design}{a specification of the reduced design used as a comparison to see what
how much better \code{fit} describes the data.
Analogous to the \code{design} parameter in \code{glm_gp()}, it can be either a \code{formula},
a \code{model.matrix()}, or a \code{vector}. \cr
Only one of \code{contrast} or \code{reduced_design} must be specified.}

\item{full_design}{option to specify an alternative \code{full_design} that can differ from
\code{fit$model_matrix}. Can be a \code{formula} or a \code{matrix}. Default: \code{fit$model_matrix}}

\item{subset_to}{a vector with the same length as \code{ncol(fit$data)} or  an expression
that evaluates to such a vector. The expression can reference columns from \code{colData(fit$data)}.
A typical use case in single cell analysis would be to subset to a specific cell type
(e.g. \code{subset_to = cell_type == "T-cells"}). Note that if this argument is set a new
the model for the \code{full_design} is re-fit.\cr
Default: \code{NULL} which means that the data is not subset.}

\item{pseudobulk_by}{\emph{DEPRECTATED}, please use the \link{pseudobulk} function instead. \cr
A vector with the same length as \code{ncol(fit$data)} that is used to
split the columns into different groups (calls \code{\link[=split]{split()}}). \code{pseudobulk_by} can also be an
expression that evaluates to a vector. The expression can reference columns from \code{colData(fit$data)}. \cr
The counts are summed across the groups
to create "pseudobulk" samples. This is typically used in single cell analysis if the cells come
from different samples to get a proper estimate of the differences. This is particularly powerful
in combination with the \code{subset_to} parameter to analyze differences between samples for
subgroups of cells. Note that this does a fresh fit for both the full and the reduced design.
Default: \code{NULL} which means that the data is not aggregated.}

\item{pval_adjust_method}{one of the p-value adjustment method from
\link{p.adjust.methods}. Default: \code{"BH"}.}

\item{sort_by}{the name of the column or an expression used to sort the result. If \code{sort_by} is \code{NULL}
the table is not sorted. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{decreasing}{boolean to decide if the result is sorted increasing or decreasing
order. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{n_max}{the maximum number of rows to return. Default: \code{Inf} which means that all
rows are returned}

\item{max_lfc}{set the maximum absolute log fold change that is returned. Large log fold changes
occur for lowly expressed genes because the ratio of two small numbers can be impractically large. For example, limiting
the range of log fold changes can clarify the patterns in a volcano plot. Default: \code{10} which
corresponds to a thousand-fold (2^10) increase in expression.}

\item{verbose}{a boolean that indicates if information about the individual steps are printed
while fitting the GLM. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with the following columns
\describe{
\item{name}{the rownames of the input data}
\item{pval}{the p-values of the quasi-likelihood ratio test}
\item{adj_pval}{the adjusted p-values returned from \code{\link[=p.adjust]{p.adjust()}}}
\item{f_statistic}{the F-statistic: \eqn{F = (Dev_full - Dev_red) / (df_1 * disp_ql-shrunken)}}
\item{df1}{the degrees of freedom of the test: \code{ncol(design) - ncol(reduced_design)}}
\item{df2}{the degrees of freedom of the fit: \code{ncol(data) - ncol(design) + df_0}}
\item{lfc}{the log2-fold change. If the alternative model is specified by \code{reduced_design} will
be \code{NA}.}
}
}
\description{
Conduct a quasi-likelihood ratio test for a Gamma-Poisson fit.
}
\details{
The \code{fact()} helper function simplifies the specification of a contrast for complex experimental designs.
Instead of working out which combination of coefficients corresponds to a research question,
you can simply specify the two conditions that you want to compare.

You can only call the \code{fact} function inside the \code{contrast} argument. The arguments are the selected factor levels
for each covariate. To compare two conditions, simply subtract the two \code{fact} calls. Internally, the package
calls \link{model.matrix} using the provided values and the original formula from the fit to produce a vector.
Subtracting two of these vectors produces a contrast vector. Missing covariates are filled with the first factor level
or zero for numerical covariates.
